BananaOS.py is for Linux and Windows (Though not tested on windows)

full Windows support will be added soon (next 2 weeks or so)

commands for idk.py (Linux):

disk (shows disk info)

format (formats virtual disk)

shutdown (guess what it does)

ls (shows directory)

netconfig (configures ip (not actually) for future use)

dialup (connects to BananaBBS using port 2525)

Login is: user:sky pass:kalli

BananaBBS has been released, it uses port 2525. Acts like a builten board system with basic messaging (Used ChatGPT for this lol)
